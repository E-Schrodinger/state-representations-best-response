# Best-Response conditions for State Space Representations
Best-Response (BR) conditions for various state spaces in the Iterated Prisoner's dilemma (IPD) environment. We solved for BR conditions for the Win-Stay, Lose-Shift (WSLS), Grim-Trigger (GT), TiT-for-Tat (TfT), and Repeat State Space.

For the WSLS and the GT state spaces, we followed

Modified to add exploration 

For the TfT and Repeat state spces, we followd
