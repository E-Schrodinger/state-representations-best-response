# Best-Response conditions for State Space Representations
Best-Response (BR) conditions for various state spaces in the Iterated Prisoner's dilemma (IPD) environment. We solved for BR conditions for the Win-Stay, Lose-Shift (WSLS), Grim-Trigger (GT), TiT-for-Tat (TfT), and Repeat State Space.

For the WSLS and the GT state spaces, we followed [(Usui and Ueda, 2021)](#usui2021) and modified to add exploration.

For the TfT and Repeat state spaces, we followed [(Barfuss and Mann, 2022)](#barfuss2022).
